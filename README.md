# wp-migrate.sh

`wp-migrate.sh` migrates WordPress sites in two modes:

1. **Push mode**: Pushes a WordPress site's `wp-content` directory and database export from a source server to a destination server via SSH.
2. **Archive mode**: Imports WordPress backup archives (currently supports **Duplicator**, **Jetpack Backup**, and **Solid Backups** (formerly BackupBuddy); designed to support UpdraftPlus and other formats in future releases) directly on the destination server without requiring SSH access to the source.

Both modes coordinate the entire workflow, including maintenance mode, database handling, file sync, and cache maintenance.

## Features

### Push Mode
- Verifies WordPress installations on both source and destination before proceeding.
- Enables maintenance mode on both sides during a real migration to minimise downtime (skip the source with `--no-maint-source`).
- Exports the database, transfers it to the destination, and imports it by default (disable with `--no-import-db`; gzipped dumps are decompressed automatically).
- Rewrites migrated URLs so the destination keeps its own domain via `wp search-replace` (skipped for dry runs or `--no-import-db`; use `--no-search-replace` to skip bulk search-replace and only update home/siteurl options).
- Creates a timestamped backup of the destination `wp-content` directory before replacing it.
- Syncs the entire `wp-content` tree with rsync archive mode; files on the destination are overwritten.
- **Excludes `object-cache.php`** to preserve destination caching infrastructure and prevent fatal errors from missing PHP extensions (Redis, Memcache, etc.).
- Optionally flushes the destination Object Cache Pro/Redis cache when `wp redis` is available.
- Supports a comprehensive dry-run mode that previews every step without mutating either server.

### Archive Mode
- Imports WordPress backup archives (currently supports **Duplicator**, **Jetpack Backup**, and **Solid Backups**; designed to support additional formats).
  - **Duplicator**: ZIP archives with `dup-installer/dup-database__*.sql` structure
  - **Jetpack Backup**: ZIP archives with `sql/*.sql` multi-file structure
  - **Solid Backups** (formerly BackupBuddy): ZIP archives with split SQL files in `wp-content/uploads/backupbuddy_temp/{BACKUP_ID}/` (one file per table, automatically consolidated during import)
- **Extensible adapter system** makes adding new backup formats simple (see [src/lib/adapters/README.md](src/lib/adapters/README.md) for contributor guide).
- **Auto-detects backup format** or accepts explicit `--archive-type` for manual override.
- Automatically extracts and detects database and wp-content from archives with smart directory scoring.
- Pre-flight disk space validation ensures 3x archive size is available (archive + extraction + buffer).
- Creates timestamped backups of both the destination database and wp-content before any destructive operations.
- Automatically detects and aligns table prefix if the imported database uses a different prefix than the destination's `wp-config.php` (supports complex prefixes with underscores like `my_site_`, `wp_live_2024_`).
- Automatically detects imported site URLs and performs search-replace to align with the destination site URLs (use `--no-search-replace` to skip bulk search-replace and only update home/siteurl options).
- **Removes `object-cache.php`** from imported archive to preserve destination caching infrastructure and prevent fatal errors from missing PHP extensions (Redis, Memcache, etc.).
- Provides comprehensive rollback instructions with exact commands to restore both backups if needed.
- Auto-cleanup of temporary extraction directory on success; kept on failure for debugging.
- Supports dry-run mode to preview the import workflow without making any changes.

## Requirements

### Push Mode
- WordPress CLI (`wp`)
- `rsync`
- `ssh`
- `gzip` (also required on the destination when importing compressed dumps)

Run the script from the WordPress root on the source server (where `wp-config.php` lives). The destination host must be reachable over SSH and capable of running `wp` commands.

### Archive Mode
- WordPress CLI (`wp`)
- `file` (for archive type detection)
- `unzip` and `tar` (for archive format extraction - Duplicator uses ZIP, Jetpack uses TAR.GZ)

Run the script from the WordPress root on the destination server (where `wp-config.php` lives). The backup archive must be accessible on the filesystem.

## Usage

### Push Mode
```bash
./wp-migrate.sh --dest-host user@dest.example.com --dest-root /var/www/site [options]
```

Common examples:
- Real migration with default behaviour:
  ```bash
  ./wp-migrate.sh --dest-host wp@dest --dest-root /var/www/site
  ```
- Dry run with an additional rsync option (e.g., exclude a directory):
  ```bash
  ./wp-migrate.sh --dest-host wp@dest --dest-root /var/www/site \
    --dry-run --rsync-opt '--exclude=uploads/large-folders/'
  ```
- Migrate but skip importing the database on the destination:
  ```bash
  ./wp-migrate.sh --dest-host wp@dest --dest-root /var/www/site --no-import-db
  ```

### Archive Mode
```bash
./wp-migrate.sh --archive /path/to/backup [options]
```

Common examples:
- Import a backup archive (auto-detect format):
  ```bash
  # Duplicator
  ./wp-migrate.sh --archive /backups/duplicator-site.zip

  # Jetpack Backup
  ./wp-migrate.sh --archive /backups/jetpack-backup.tar.gz

  # Solid Backups (formerly BackupBuddy)
  ./wp-migrate.sh --archive /backups/solidbackups-full.zip
  ```
- Import with explicit format specification:
  ```bash
  ./wp-migrate.sh --archive /backups/site.zip --archive-type duplicator
  ./wp-migrate.sh --archive /backups/backup.tar.gz --archive-type jetpack
  ./wp-migrate.sh --archive /backups/backup.zip --archive-type solidbackups
  ```
- Preview import without making changes (dry run):
  ```bash
  ./wp-migrate.sh --archive /backups/site.zip --dry-run
  ```
- **Backward compatible** - old Duplicator flag still works:
  ```bash
  ./wp-migrate.sh --duplicator-archive /backups/site.zip
  ```

**Note:** Currently supports **Duplicator**, **Jetpack Backup**, and **Solid Backups** archives. The extensible adapter architecture supports adding UpdraftPlus and other formatsâ€”contributors can add adapters following the guide in [src/lib/adapters/README.md](src/lib/adapters/README.md).

## Options

### Common Options (both modes)
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--dry-run` | Preview the workflow without making changes. No files are created, maintenance mode is not toggled, caches are left untouched, and database operations are described rather than executed. Safe to run on production sites. |
| `--verbose` | Show additional details during migration. Displays dependency checks, command construction, archive detection process, and other diagnostic information. Useful for understanding what the script is doing and troubleshooting issues. Can be combined with `--dry-run` to preview detailed workflow. |
| `--trace` | Show every command before execution (implies `--verbose`). Displays exact commands (rsync, wp-cli, ssh, etc.) with all arguments before running them. Useful for debugging, filing bug reports, or manually reproducing operations. Output can be copied/pasted to run commands manually. |
| `--help` | Print usage information and exit. |
| `--version` | Show version information and exit. |

### Push Mode Options

#### Required Flags
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--dest-host <user@host>` | **Required.** SSH connection string for the destination server (e.g., `wp@example.com` or `user@192.168.1.100`). |
| `--dest-root </abs/path>` | **Required.** Absolute path to WordPress root directory on destination server (e.g., `/var/www/html` or `/home/user/public_html`). |

#### Database Options
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--import-db` | (Deprecated) Explicitly request database import on destination. The script imports by default, so this flag is no longer needed. |
| `--no-import-db` | Skip importing the database on destination after transfer. The SQL dump will be transferred but not imported. Useful for manual review before import. If the dump is gzipped (`.gz`), decompress it first: `gunzip dump.sql.gz && wp db import dump.sql` |
| `--no-search-replace` | Skip bulk search-replace operations but still update `home` and `siteurl` options to destination URLs. Useful for faster migrations when you only need the site to load at destination but don't need to replace URLs in post content, metadata, or other options. **Warning:** Only `home` and `siteurl` WordPress options are updated; all other content (posts, metadata, serialized options) remains unchanged. The script logs the manual `wp search-replace` command if you need to run it later. |
| `--no-gzip` | Skip gzipping the database dump before transfer. By default, the script gzips the dump to reduce transfer time. Use this flag if you prefer uncompressed dumps or have very fast network. |

#### Source Site Options
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--no-maint-source` | Skip enabling maintenance mode on the source site during migration. By default, source site is placed in maintenance mode to prevent content changes during migration. Use this flag if you want the source site to remain accessible (not recommended for production migrations). |

#### Destination URL Overrides
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--dest-domain <host>` | Override destination domain detection. By default, the script uses the SSH hostname. Specify custom domain for search-replace operations (e.g., `--dest-domain example.com`). Automatically prepends `https://` unless you provide full URL. |
| `--dest-home-url <url>` | Force the destination `home` URL for search-replace operations. Overrides auto-detection. Must be full URL (e.g., `https://example.com`). The `home` option controls the site's front-end URL. |
| `--dest-site-url <url>` | Force the destination `siteurl` for search-replace operations. Overrides auto-detection. Must be full URL (e.g., `https://example.com`). The `siteurl` option controls the WordPress admin URL. |

#### Transfer Options
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--rsync-opt <opt>` | Append additional rsync option (can be specified multiple times). Useful for custom rsync behavior like bandwidth limiting (`--rsync-opt '--bwlimit=1000'`) or excluding patterns (`--rsync-opt '--exclude=*.log'`). |
| `--ssh-opt <opt>` | Append additional SSH `-o` option (can be specified multiple times). Useful for SSH configuration like jump hosts (`--ssh-opt 'ProxyJump=bastion.example.com'`), custom ports (`--ssh-opt 'Port=2222'`), or key files (`--ssh-opt 'IdentityFile=~/.ssh/custom_key'`). |

### Archive Mode Options

#### Required Flags
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--archive </path/to/backup>` | **Required.** Path to backup archive file or extracted directory. Supports Duplicator (ZIP), Jetpack Backup (ZIP, TAR.GZ, TAR, or extracted directory), and Solid Backups (ZIP or extracted directory). Format is auto-detected. Mutually exclusive with `--dest-host`. |
| `--archive-type <type>` | **Optional.** Explicitly specify archive format: `duplicator`, `jetpack`, or `solidbackups`. Useful when auto-detection fails or you want to skip detection. If not specified, the script tries each adapter's validation function to identify the format. |
| `--duplicator-archive </path/to/backup.zip>` | **Deprecated.** Use `--archive` instead. Maintained for backward compatibility - internally converted to `--archive --archive-type=duplicator`. Will be removed in v3.0.0. |

#### Database Options
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--no-search-replace` | Skip bulk search-replace operations but still update `home` and `siteurl` options to destination URLs. Useful for faster migrations when you only need the site to load at destination but don't need to replace URLs in post content, metadata, or other options. **Warning:** Only `home` and `siteurl` WordPress options are updated; all other content (posts, metadata, serialized options) remains unchanged. The script logs the manual `wp search-replace` command if you need to run it later. |

### Plugin/Theme Preservation Options (both modes)

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--preserve-dest-plugins` | Preserve destination plugins and themes that don't exist in the source. After wp-content sync, the script detects unique destination plugins/themes, restores them from backup, and automatically deactivates restored plugins (themes remain available but inactive). Useful for preserving host-specific plugins or custom configurations. Works in both push and archive modes. |
| `--stellarsites` | Enable StellarSites managed hosting compatibility mode. Automatically enables `--preserve-dest-plugins` and excludes the destination `mu-plugins/` directory and `mu-plugins.php` loader file from being overwritten during wp-content sync. Prevents conflicts with StellarSites' protected mu-plugins system (e.g., `mu-plugins/stellarsites-cloud`). Recommended for StellarSites and similar managed WordPress hosts that provide system-level mu-plugins. Works in both push and archive modes. |

## Workflow Overview

### Push Mode
1. **Preflight**: Ensures the script runs from a WordPress root, verifies the presence of required binaries, confirms both WP installations, and tests SSH connectivity.
2. **Discovery**: Determines source and destination `wp-content` paths and logs disk usage details.
3. **Maintenance Mode**: Activates maintenance on both sides during a real migration (`wp maintenance-mode activate`). Dry runs only log what would happen.
4. **Database Step**:
   - Real run: Exports the source DB (optionally gzipped), stores it in `db-dumps/`, creates the destination `db-imports` directory, transfers the dump, and imports it by default (gzipped files are expanded on the destination first; use `--no-import-db` to skip). When domains differ, it aligns the destination database back to its original URL with `wp search-replace` and resets the `home`/`siteurl` options. Use `--no-search-replace` to skip bulk search-replace and only update `home`/`siteurl` options (faster but leaves URLs in content unchanged). Supply `--dest-domain`, `--dest-home-url`, or `--dest-site-url` if you need to override the detected destination values.
   - Dry run: Logs the planned export, transfer, import, and any pending URL replacements without creating `db-dumps/` or touching the destination.
5. **File Sync**: Builds rsync options (archive mode, compression, link preservation, no ownership/permission changes) and syncs `wp-content` from source to destination. Dry runs leverage `rsync --dry-run --itemize-changes`.
6. **Post Tasks**: Flushes the destination Object Cache Pro cache via `wp redis flush` when the command exists. Dry runs skip execution and log intent.
7. **Cleanup**: Disables maintenance mode (real runs only) and logs final status as well as the dump location or future import instructions when imports are skipped.

### Archive Mode
1. **Preflight**: Ensures the script runs from a WordPress root, verifies required binaries, confirms WordPress installation, validates the archive file exists.
2. **Format Detection**: Auto-detects archive format (Duplicator, Jetpack Backup, or Solid Backups) by trying each adapter's validation function. Each adapter checks for format-specific signature files:
   - **Duplicator**: Looks for `installer.php` and `dup-installer/` directory
   - **Jetpack Backup**: Looks for `meta.json` + `sql/wp_options.sql` (archives) or `sql/` + `meta.json` + `wp-content/` (extracted directories)
   - **Solid Backups**: Looks for `importbuddy.php` or `backupbuddy_dat.php` signature files
   - Alternatively, use explicit `--archive-type` to skip auto-detection
3. **Dependency Check**: Verifies format-specific tools are available (e.g., `unzip` for ZIP archives, `tar` for TAR/GZ archives).
4. **URL Capture**: Captures current destination site URLs (`home` and `siteurl` options) before any operations.
5. **Disk Space Check**: Validates that 3x the archive size is available (archive + extraction + buffer) and fails early if insufficient.
6. **Extraction**: Extracts the archive to a temporary directory using the appropriate adapter's extract function.
7. **Discovery**: Auto-detects the database file and wp-content directory using format-specific adapter functions:
   - **Duplicator**: Single SQL file in `dup-installer/dup-database__*.sql`
   - **Jetpack Backup**: Multiple SQL files in `sql/*.sql` directory
   - **Solid Backups**: Split SQL files (one per table) in `wp-content/uploads/backupbuddy_temp/{BACKUP_ID}/`, automatically consolidated during import
   - Smart directory scoring based on presence of plugins/themes/uploads subdirectories
8. **Maintenance Mode**: Activates maintenance mode on the destination during a real import. Dry runs only log what would happen.
9. **Backup Database**: Creates a timestamped gzipped backup of the current destination database in `db-backups/` before import.
10. **Backup wp-content**: Creates a timestamped backup of the current destination wp-content directory before replacement.
11. **Import Database**: Imports the database from the archive (Solid Backups split SQL files are consolidated first).
12. **Table Prefix Alignment**: Detects the table prefix from the imported database by verifying core WordPress tables (`options`, `posts`, `users`) exist with the same prefix. If the imported prefix differs from `wp-config.php`, automatically updates `wp-config.php` to match. Supports complex prefixes with underscores (e.g., `my_site_`, `wp_live_2024_`).
13. **URL Alignment**: Detects the imported site URLs, performs `wp search-replace` to align all URL references to the destination URLs (captured in step 4), and updates the `home`/`siteurl` options. Use `--no-search-replace` to skip bulk search-replace and only update `home`/`siteurl` options (faster but leaves URLs in content unchanged).
14. **Replace wp-content**: Removes the existing wp-content directory and replaces it completely with the wp-content from the archive (1:1 copy). The `object-cache.php` file is excluded to preserve destination caching infrastructure.
15. **Post Tasks**: Flushes the Object Cache Pro cache via `wp redis flush` when available.
16. **Cleanup**: Disables maintenance mode and removes the temporary extraction directory on success (keeps it on failure for debugging).
17. **Rollback Instructions**: Logs detailed rollback commands showing how to restore both the database and wp-content backups if needed.

## Directories and Logging

### Push Mode
- Real runs create `logs/` with timestamped log files (`migrate-wpcontent-push-*.log`) and `db-dumps/` for exported databases.
- Dry runs do **not** create or modify directories; logging is routed to `/dev/null` to ensure a zero-impact preview.

### Archive Mode
- Real runs create `logs/` with timestamped log files (`migrate-archive-import-*.log`) and `db-backups/` for database backups before import.
- Timestamped wp-content backups are created alongside the original wp-content directory (e.g., `wp-content.backup-20251009-123456`).
- Temporary extraction directory is auto-created in `$TMPDIR` (typically `/tmp`) and removed on success.
- Dry runs do **not** create or modify directories; logging is routed to `/dev/null` to ensure a zero-impact preview.

## Safety Characteristics

### Push Mode
- A timestamped backup of the destination `wp-content` directory is created before files are overwritten.
- Rsync runs without `--delete`, so unmatched files on the destination remain in place, and remote ownership/permissions are untouched (`--no-perms --no-owner --no-group`).
- Maintenance commands run under `set -e`; if enabling or disabling maintenance fails the script aborts to prevent partial migrations.
- Cache flushing is attempted but non-blocking; failures are logged and the run continues.

### Archive Mode
- Both database and wp-content are backed up **before** any destructive operations occur.
- Database backup is created as a gzipped SQL dump in `db-backups/pre-archive-backup_<timestamp>.sql.gz`.
- wp-content backup is created as a complete timestamped copy (e.g., `wp-content.backup-<timestamp>`).
- Comprehensive rollback instructions are logged showing exact commands to restore both backups.
- Maintenance mode activation runs under `set -e`; if it fails the script aborts before making any changes.
- Temporary extraction directory is preserved on failure for debugging (removed on success).
- The script ensures a perfect 1:1 copy of the backed-up site with only URLs changed to match the destination.

## Git Workflow
Use the repo's Git helpers to keep changes small, reviewable, and easy to trace.

1. Branching: start from `main` and create a descriptive branch such as `feature/<slug>` for enhancements or `fix/<slug>` for bug fixes.
2. Commits: commit in small slices using the `.gitmessage` template. Run `git config commit.template .gitmessage` once per clone, then write messages as `type: short imperative summary` (e.g., `feat: add staging backup option`).
3. Changelog: update `CHANGELOG.md` under the `[Unreleased]` section with every feature or fix.
4. Review: open a pull request (even when working solo) and use the checklist in `.github/pull_request_template.md` to verify testing and documentation.
5. Merging: keep `main` release-ready by merging with `git merge --no-ff` or by squashing after review; delete the feature branch once merged.
6. Releases: tag meaningful milestones (e.g., `git tag v0.3.0`) and include a brief summary in the pull request or release notes.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure `wp` runs correctly on both hosts; authentication or environment issues will surface during the verification step.
- Supply additional SSH options with repeated `--ssh-opt` flags (e.g., alternate ports or identities).
- Install [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) to lint modifications; the current script is ShellCheck-clean.

## Development

### Source Code Structure (v2+)

Starting with v2.0.0, the codebase uses a modular source structure for easier maintenance:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ header.sh         # Shebang, defaults, variable declarations
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.sh       # Core utilities (log, err, validate_url)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ functions.sh  # All other functions
â””â”€â”€ main.sh           # Argument parsing and main execution
```

The single-file `wp-migrate.sh` at the repo root is built from these modular source files.

### Building from Source

If you modify files in `src/`, you must rebuild the script:

```bash
# Install dependencies (macOS/Linux)
# - shellcheck (linting)
# - make (build system)

# Build the single-file script
make build

# This will:
# 1. Run shellcheck on the concatenated source
# 2. Concatenate src/ files into dist/wp-migrate.sh
# 3. Copy to ./wp-migrate.sh (repo root)
# 4. Generate SHA256 checksum
```

### Git Hook Setup (Recommended)

To prevent accidentally committing source changes without rebuilding, install the pre-commit hook:

```bash
ln -s ../../.githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This hook will block commits if you modify `src/` files without updating both `wp-migrate.sh` and `wp-migrate.sh.sha256`.

### Makefile Targets

- `make build` - Build the single-file script from modular source
- `make test` - Run shellcheck on the complete built script
- `make clean` - Remove build artifacts (`dist/` directory)
- `make help` - Show available targets
