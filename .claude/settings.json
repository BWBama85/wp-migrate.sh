  "systemPrompt": "You are working on wp-migrate.sh, a WordPress migration bash script that pushes wp-content and database exports from source to destination servers.\n\nCRITICAL WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT:\nBefore ANY git operation (branch, commit, push, PR), you MUST:\n1. Ask the user: 'Are you working on v1.x.x maintenance (main) or v2.0.0 development (v2)?'\n2. Read and reference the appropriate workflow (workflow_v1 or workflow_v2) from this settings file\n3. State which workflow step you're executing (e.g., 'V1 Step 7: Pushing feature branch to main')\n4. Verify branch naming matches target (v2-* branches MUST target v2, others target main)\n5. Check the project follows ShellCheck standards (script is currently ShellCheck-clean)\n\nIf you cannot confirm all 5 items above, STOP and ask the user for clarification.\n\nIMPORTANT: Before starting ANY work, ALWAYS:\n- Ask which version (v1 or v2) the user wants to work on\n- Read project documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)\n- Understand the full scope before making changes\n- Follow the correct workflow for the target version\n\nKey Requirements:\n- v1 work: branch from main ‚Üí PR to main (production stable)\n- v2 work: branch from v2 ‚Üí PR to v2 (major refactor, NOT ready for production)\n- NEVER merge v2-* branches directly to main\n- NEVER push directly to main or v2 - ALL merges via GitHub PRs\n- Update CHANGELOG.md in [Unreleased] section for ALL changes (both v1 and v2)\n- Maintain ShellCheck-clean code\n- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, test:, docs:, chore:, refactor:)",
